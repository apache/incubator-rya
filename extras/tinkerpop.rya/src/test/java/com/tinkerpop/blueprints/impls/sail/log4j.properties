# Tinker Pop's "blueprints-sail-graph" actually loads it's own log4j properties
# from the classpath.  Unfortunately, it creates a file (blueprints.log) and 
# this can be messy.  

# This log4j.properties file overwrites Tinker Pop's "blueprints-sail-graph"
# log4j properties in order to write to the console.
